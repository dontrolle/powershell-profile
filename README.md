Relies on a few modules - can be gotten with PowerShellGet. If PowerShellGet is not already on your system, see [Installing PSGet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/gallery/installing-psget?view=powershell-7.1)

## Modules and scripts
* [PSReadLine](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSReadLine)

* [Posh-Git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git)

  * Remember to install a Nerd Font and use it your shell (I like Windows Terminal), see https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/fonts
  * For the font, I like "FuraCode Nerd Font Mono", because it has nordic characters; get it (or other Nerd Fonts) here: <https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads>
